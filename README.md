# The-Forbidden-Maze
This is a maze game with generated ASCII art. The character (you) have teleported to the Dark World while sleeping and need to solve riddles and the forbidden maze to escape back to reality.

NOTE: The walkthrough file includes the answer to all the riddles and has a map of the maze.

NOTE 2: The animation works best when the screens refresh rate is at 60Hz (tested using vs code)
